# Module 4 Final Project: recommendation system


## Introduction

Recommending people to buy what they think they need or near to what they used to use in past is one of the most effective way to encourage people to buy more. A recommender system, or a recommendation system is one of the ways that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.

This thickness is utilized in a variety of areas such as playlist generators for video and music services like MovieLens, that helps you find movies you will like. Rate movies to build a custom taste profile, then MovieLens recommends other movies for you to watch.

The dataset that I have used in this project is from a movie recommendation service, MovieLens. This dataset contains 100836 ratings and 3683 tag applications across 9742 movies. These data were created by 610 users between March 29, 1996 and September 24, 2018. This dataset was generated on September 26, 2018.


## Problem Statement
 Making movie recommendations based on the MovieLens dataset from the GroupLens research lab at the University of Minnesota. So, build a model that provides top 5 movie recommendations to a user, based on their ratings of other movies.

## Results 
In this project, I created a recommendation system which recommend movies to old and new users based on rating. At first, I scraped the data.Second, explored and illustrated the data. In this part I found, almost 42% of the movies in the MovieLens have drama genre. After drama, comedy and action by 38.76% and 30.50% are in second and third places. In my dataset, year 1995 had highest amount of movie releases among the other years.

And also, most common ratings are 4 and 3.

At the end, I building my recommendation system based on the Collaborative Filtering Systems. Collaborative filtering systems use a collection of user rating of items to make recommendations.
